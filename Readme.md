### Data-Driven World
Under the predict link in the navbar, users can input values for the predictors in the form. Upon clicking submit, the website will display the predicted crop yield based on the value of the predictors.

To find out the coefficients the models is based upon, users can click on the info link in the navrbar.

To check out the data that the model is based upon, users can click on the predictor links in the navbar to see the graphs of crop yield against predictor values.

### Global Humanities
